# Vampyr: The Talisman of Invocation Utilities

vampyr-utils is a repo for utilities for decoding files from _Vampyr:
Talisman of Invocation_, the 1989 DOS game made by Victor Shao and Brian Weston.
For more information on the game, visit the unofficial wiki:
https://vampyr-talisman-of-invocation.fandom.com/wiki/Vampyr:_Talisman_of_Invocation_Wikia

Courtesy of the Internet Archive, the game can be downloaded here:

Unless you have an MS-DOS computer, I'd suggest playing _Vampyr_ using DOSBox.
That can be downloaded from the DOSBox website:
