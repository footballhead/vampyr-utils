Version Differences
-------------------

There are two versions of Vampyr: 1.1 and 2.0. In 1.1 there is a bug which
prevents the player from finishing a storyline critical quest, thereby
preventing the completion of the game. Version 2.0 fixed that bug -- along with
several others listed in the README -- and changes some of the graphics.

Therefore, play version 2.0 if you want to beat the game.
